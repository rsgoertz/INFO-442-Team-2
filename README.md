## Mission Statement
To engage Seattle in the fight to end local hunger.


## Problem Statement
Homeless and low-income residents of Seattle are often faced with the challenge of acquiring their next meal, often not having access to information that can provide locations serving this need. This challenge exacerbates an already dire situation that can lead to diminished health and the possibility of starvation. 

What makes food insecurity difficult to solve is its underlying causes—poverty, income inequality, and lack of affordable housing. Consequently, hunger often precedes homelessness because people who are forced to decide between paying for housing or groceries will, more often than not, choose the former. 1 in 10 Washington citizens struggle with hunger on a daily basis and we would like to provide a resource that helps them have an equal opportunity to a meal.

For those impacted by hunger free meal services do exist, however; even these services can prevent certain individuals from receiving a meal. Meal services are not created equal and many come with a set of requirements to get access. These requirements can range from ethnicity to age and might only be available upon arrival to the facility, leaving those that don’t fit the requirements to continue looking for a meal.
